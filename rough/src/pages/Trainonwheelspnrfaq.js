          You can check the PNR status of your train reservation at any time
          from the day of booking until the journey is completed. Once the train
          reaches its destination station, the PNR becomes invalid, and no
          further journeys can be made using the same PNR. However, the PNR
          number is stored in the database of Indian Railways (CRIS) for up to
          nine months.{" "}

            that while your seat is not confirmed, you are guaranteed a place to
            sit on the train. If someone cancels their confirmed ticket, you
            might get a confirmed seat later.

            confirmed.

      questionText: "Are these PNR numbers ever reused?",

        <p>
          Yes, PNR numbers are not reused for new reservations. Once a journey
          associated with a particular PNR is completed, that PNR number is
          retired and not assigned to any new reservations. This ensures the
          uniqueness of each PNR and avoids confusion or conflicts with past or
          future bookings

        <p>
          If a passenger fails to produce a printout of their e-ticket booked
          through the IRCTC website but remembers the PNR number, there
          shouldn't be any issue as long as they can provide a valid ID proof.
          Alternatively, showing the booking SMS on their mobile device is also
          acceptable. However, if both the printout and the SMS are unavailable,
          the TTE may impose a penalty of Rs. 50 per ticket. For counter
          tickets, passengers must carry both the original ticket and a valid ID
          proof. If the ticket is lost but the PNR number is remembered,
          passengers can request a duplicate ticket from railway reservation
          counters.

          While checking the PNR status on the Indian Railway website, personal
          details such as name, age, and gender are not provided due to privacy
          concerns. However, individuals who have booked tickets can access this
          information by logging into the IRCTC website using their username and
          password and making a PNR enquiry there.

          <p>
            On a paper ticket released in a railway booking counter, the PNR
            number is on the top left of the ticket. The PNR number on ticket
            might be split right into 3-7(digits) form (e.g. 890-1234567) on
            paper ticket.
          </p>
          <p>
            On IRCTC e-ticket or any other agency e-ticket the PNR number can be
            on the top left of the ticket. PNR might also be on SMS alert on
            your mobile if you have booked e-ticket and provided your mobile
            number. Below are two ticket samples of Online/IRCTC Ticket and
